In a **T+1** environment, the luxury of time disappears. While T+2 allows for overnight processing, T+1 forces almost all critical trade-matching and reporting into the **same day (T)**.

In the European context (with the UK and EU currently targeting October 2027 for this transition), the "active" window for a Fund Manager (FM) to reinvest shifts from the morning of T+1 to the late evening of T or the very first hour of T+1.

### **Trade Date (T): The "Compression" Phase**

In T+1, Day T is no longer just about taking orders; it’s about finishing the work that used to happen on T+1.

| Process / Task | Approx. Time | Duration | Responsible Party | Changes from T+2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Order Validation & KYC** | 09:00 – 13:00 | **~4 hours** | Transfer Agent (TA) | Stays the same, but higher pressure. |
| **Aggregation of Orders** | 13:00 – 14:30 | **~1.5 hours** | Transfer Agent (TA) | Accelerated to feed the FM faster. |
| **NAV Calculation** | 17:30 – 20:30 | **~3 hours** | Fund Administrator | **Hard Compression:** Must be done faster. |
| **Trade Allocation & Affirmation** | 18:00 – 21:00 | **~3 hours** | TA & Custodian | **Major Shift:** Must happen on T, not T+1. |

### **Trade Date + 1 (T+1): The "Execution & Settlement" Phase**

In T+1, this is both the day the cash arrives AND the day you must have already finished your trading if you wanted to be "market-neutral."

| Process / Task | Approx. Time | Duration | Responsible Party | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Final Cash Confirmation** | 07:00 – 08:00 | **~1 hour** | TA / Custodian | FM gets the "Green Light" that cash is moving. |
| **Reinvestment Execution** | 08:00 – 10:00 | **~2 hours** | **Fund Manager (FM)** | **The Reinvestment Point:** Must happen immediately. |
| **Cash Settlement** | 09:00 – 11:00 | **~2 hours** | Custodian / Banks | Physical cash from subscribers hits the account. |
| **FX Execution (if needed)** | 09:00 – 11:00 | **~2 hours** | FM / Treasury | Critical for non-base currency funds. |

### **Key Differences & Impacts**

#### **1. The "Reinvestment" Timing**

* **In T+2:** The FM has the whole morning of T+1 to "shop" in the market.
* **In T+1:** The FM must trade by **09:00 or 10:00 on T+1** at the latest to ensure they are synchronized with the incoming cash. Many FMs will actually move to **algorithmic trading** on T evening (post-NAV) to avoid the T+1 morning rush.

#### **2. The 80% Reduction in "Error Correction" Time**

Under T+2, if a trade was mismatched on T evening, you had all of T+1 to fix it. In T+1, if a trade isn't affirmed by roughly **21:00 on T**, it will likely **fail**. This is why the "Responsible Party" for many of these tasks will shift from humans to **STP (Straight-Through Processing)** engines.

#### **3. The FX Nightmare**

For a European fund buying US stocks (which are already T+1), the FM has to buy the US Dollars *before* they even know the final subscription amount, or they risk paying high "overnight" rates. This leads to:

* **Increased use of Overdrafts:** To cover the gap.
* **Pre-funding:** Keeping "lazy cash" in the fund, which can slightly drag down performance.

### **Party Responsibility Summary (T+1)**

* **Transfer Agent:** Must automate the "Order to Flow" report to be near real-time.
* **Fund Manager:** Needs to be ready to trade in the "Late Shift" (T evening) or "Early Shift" (T+1 dawn).
* **Custodian:** Moves from a "settlement" role to a "real-time monitoring" role.
